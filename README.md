## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to increase proficiency in using CSS Grid. 

## What I will use

- Semantic HTML
- CSS Flex
- CSS Grid 
- Media queries and responsive units

## What's different

- Last project, I used grid however I did not use mobile-first approach which complicated development. This time we will be using a mobile-first approach without a grid and then use grid for desktop optimization.
- This is also the first time I am writing an actual README.md file

## Challenges I came across

- Had trouble making text responsive and making it stay in the respective cards
- Adjusted that with a clamp on text
- Assigned max width and height so that text does not overflow
